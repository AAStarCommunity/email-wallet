# ZK-Email Wallet

ZK-Email Wallet is a non-custodial crypto wallet, which is managed through email. 
The wallet supports:
* ETH transfers (from plain ETH addresses to email wallets and the other way, and also between email wallets);
* ERC20 transfers;
* Uniswap 

---

The first version of the wallet doesn't support privacy; however in future, core parts will be reimplemented/redesigned (user flow will be the same) to achieve it.
